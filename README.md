## 1 GETTING STARTED 
In this chapter, you‚Äôll run your first Python program, hello_world.py. First, you‚Äôll need to check whether a recent version of Python is installed on your computer; if it isn‚Äôt, you‚Äôll install it. You‚Äôll also install a text editor to work with your Python programs. Text editors recognize Python code and highlight sections as you write, making it easy to understand your code‚Äôs structure. 

### Setting Up Your Programming Environment
Python differs slightly on different operating systems, so you‚Äôll need to keep a few considerations in mind. In the following sections, we‚Äôll make sure Python is set up correctly on your system. 

#### Python Versions
Every programming language evolves as new ideas and technologies emerge, and the developers of Python have continually made the language more versatile and powerful. As of this writing, the latest version is Python 3.7, but everything in this book should run on Python 3.6 or later. In this section, we‚Äôll find out if Python is already installed on your system and whether you need to install a newer version. Appendix A contains a comprehensive guide to installing the latest version of Python on each major operating system as well. Some old Python projects still use Python 2, but you should use Python 3. If Python 2 is installed on your system, it‚Äôs probably there to support some older programs that your system needs. We‚Äôll leave this installation as is, and make sure you have a more recent version to work with. 

#### Running Snippets of Python Code
You can run Python‚Äôs interpreter in a terminal window, allowing you to try bits of Python code without having to save and run an entire program. Throughout this book, you‚Äôll see code snippets that look like this: 

    ‚ûä >>> print("Hello Python interpreter!")
        Hello Python interpreter! 
   
The >>> prompt indicates that you should be using the terminal window, and the bold text is the code you should type in and then execute by pressing ENTER. Most of the examples in the book are small, self-contained programs that you‚Äôll run from your text editor rather than the terminal, because you‚Äôll write most of your code in the text editor. But sometimes basic concepts will be shown in a series of snippets run through a Python terminal session to demonstrate particular concepts more efficiently. When you see three angle brackets in a code listing ‚ûä, you‚Äôre looking at code and output from a terminal session. We‚Äôll try coding in the interpreter on your system in a moment. We‚Äôll also use a text editor to create a simple program called Hello World! that has become a staple of learning to program. There‚Äôs a long-held tradition in the programming world that printing a Hello world! message to the screen as your first program in a new language will bring you good luck. Such a simple program serves a very real purpose. If it runs correctly on your system, any Python program you write should work as well.

#### About the Sublime Text Editor
Sublime Text is a simple text editor that can be installed on all modern operating systems. Sublime Text lets you run almost all of your programs directly from the editor instead of through a terminal. Your code runs in a terminal session embedded in the Sublime Text window, which makes it easy to see the output. Sublime Text is a beginner-friendly editor, but many professional programmers use it as well. If you become comfortable using it while learning Python, you can continue using it as you progress to larger and more complicated projects. Sublime Text has a very liberal licensing policy: you can use the editor free of charge as long as you want, but the developers request that you purchase a license if you like it and want to keep using it. Appendix B provides information on other text editors. If you‚Äôre curious about the other options, you might want to skim that appendix at this point. If you want to begin programming quickly, you can use Sublime Text to start and consider other editors once you‚Äôve gained some experience as a programmer. In this chapter, I‚Äôll walk you through installing Sublime Text on your operating system. 

### Python on Different Operating Systems
Python is a cross-platform programming language, which means it runs on all the major operating systems. Any Python program you write should run on any modern computer that has Python installed. However, the methods for setting up Python on different operating systems vary slightly. In this section, you‚Äôll learn how to set up Python on your system. You‚Äôll first check whether a recent version of Python is installed on your system and install it if it‚Äôs not. Then you‚Äôll install Sublime Text. These are the only two steps that are different for each operating system. In the sections that follow, you‚Äôll run the Hello World! program and troubleshoot anything that didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôll walk you through this process for each operating system, so you‚Äôll have a beginner-friendly Python programming environment. 

#### Python on Windows 
Windows doesn‚Äôt always come with Python, so you‚Äôll probably need to install it, and then install Sublime Text. 

##### Installing Python 
First, check whether Python is installed on your system. Open a command window by entering command into the Start menu or by holding down the SHIFT key while right-clicking on your desktop and selecting Open command window here from the menu. In the terminal window, enter python in lowercase. If you get a Python prompt (>>>) in response, Python is installed on your system. If you see an error message telling you that python is not a recognized command, Python isn‚Äôt installed. In that case, or if you see a version of Python earlier than Python 3.6, you need to download a Python installer for Windows. Go to https://python.org/ and hover over the Downloads link. You should see a button for downloading the latest version of Python. Click the button, which should automatically start downloading the correct installer for your system. After you‚Äôve downloaded the file, run the installer. Make sure you select the option Add Python to PATH, which will make it easier to configure your system correctly. 

##### Running Python in a Terminal Session 
Open a command window and enter python in lowercase. You should see a Python prompt (>>>), which means Windows has found the version of Python you just installed. 

     C:\> python
     Python 3.7.2 (v3.7.2:9a3ffc0492, Dec 23 2018, 23:09:28) [MSC v.1916 64 bit
     (AMD64)] on win32
     Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
     >>> 

NOTE: If you don‚Äôt see this output or something similar, see the more detailed setup instructions in Appendix A. 

Enter the following line in your Python session, and make sure you see the output Hello Python interpreter! 
     
    >>> print("Hello Python interpreter!")
    Hello Python interpreter!
    >>> 
    
Any time you want to run a snippet of Python code, open a command window and start a Python terminal session. To close the terminal session, press CTRL-Z and then press ENTER, or enter the command exit(). 

##### Installing Sublime Text 
You can download an installer for Sublime Text at https://sublimetext.com/. Click the download link and look for a Windows installer. After downloading the installer, run the installer and accept all of its defaults. 

#### Python on macOS
Python is already installed on most macOS systems, but it‚Äôs most likely an outdated version that you won‚Äôt want to learn on. In this section, you‚Äôll install the latest version of Python, and then you‚Äôll install Sublime Text and make sure it‚Äôs configured correctly. 

##### Checking Whether Python 3 Is Installed
Open a terminal window by going to Applications ‚ñ∏ Utilities ‚ñ∏ Terminal. You can also press command-spacebar, type terminal, and then press ENTER. To see which version of Python is installed, enter python with a lowercase p‚Äîthis also starts the Python interpreter within the terminal, allowing you to enter Python commands. You should see output telling you which Python version is installed on your system and a >>> prompt where you can start entering Python commands, like this: 

    $ python
    Python 2.7.15 (default, Aug 17 2018, 22:39:05)
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.2)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits", or "license" for more information.
    >>> 
    
This output indicates that Python 2.7.15 is currently the default version installed on this computer. Once you‚Äôve seen this output, press CTRL-D or enter exit() to leave the Python prompt and return to a terminal prompt. To check whether you have Python 3 installed, enter the command python3. You‚Äôll probably get an error message, meaning you don‚Äôt have any versions of Python 3 installed. If the output shows you have Python 3.6 or a later version installed, you can skip ahead to ‚ÄúRunning Python in a Terminal Session‚Äù. If Python 3 isn‚Äôt installed by default, you‚Äôll need to install it manually. Note that whenever you see the python command in this book, you need to use the python3 command instead to make sure you‚Äôre using Python 3, not Python 2; they differ significantly enough that you‚Äôll run into trouble trying to run the code in this book using Python 2. If you see any version earlier than Python 3.6, follow the instructions in the next section to install the latest version. 

##### Installing the Latest Version of Python
You can find a Python installer for your system at https://python.org/. Hover over the Download link, and you should see a button for downloading the latest Python version. Click the button, which should automatically start downloading the correct installer for your system. After the file downloads, run the installer. When you‚Äôre finished, enter the following at a terminal prompt: 

    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.7.2 
    
You should see output similar to this, in which case, you‚Äôre ready to try out Python. Whenever you see the command python, make sure you use python3. 

##### Running Python in a Terminal Session 
You can now try running snippets of Python code by opening a terminal and typing python3. Enter the following line in the terminal session: 

    >>> print("Hello Python interpreter!")
    Hello Python interpreter!
    >>> 
    
Your message should print directly in the current terminal window. Remember that you can close the Python interpreter by pressing CTRL-D or by entering the command exit(). 

##### Installing Sublime Text 
To install the Sublime Text editor, you need to download the installer at https://sublimetext.com/. Click the Download link and look for an installer for macOS. After the installer downloads, open it and then drag the Sublime Text icon into your Applications folder. 

#### Python on Linux 
Linux systems are designed for programming, so Python is already installed on most Linux computers. The people who write and maintain Linux expect you to do your own programming at some point and encourage you to do so. For this reason, there‚Äôs very little to install and only a few settings to change to start programming. 

##### Checking Your Version of Python
Open a terminal window by running the Terminal application on your system (in Ubuntu, you can press CTRL-ALT-T). To find out which version of Python is installed, enter python3 with a lowercase p. When Python is installed, this command starts the Python interpreter. You should see output indicating which version of Python is installed and a >>> prompt where you can start entering Python commands, like this: 
    
    $ python3
    Python 3.7.2 (default, Dec 27 2018, 04:01:51)
    [GCC 7.3.0] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>
    
This output indicates that Python 3.7.2 is currently the default version of Python installed on this computer. When you‚Äôve seen this output, press CTRL-D or enter exit() to leave the Python prompt and return to a terminal prompt. Whenever you see the python command in this book, enter python3 instead. You‚Äôll need Python 3.6 or later to run the code in this book. If the Python version installed on your system is earlier than Python 3.6, refer to Appendix A to install the latest version. 

##### Running Python in a Terminal Session 
You can try running snippets of Python code by opening a terminal and entering python3, as you did when checking your version. Do this again, and when you have Python running, enter the following line in the terminal session: 

    >>> print("Hello Python interpreter!")
    Hello Python interpreter!
    >>> 
    
The message should print directly in the current terminal window. Remember that you can close the Python interpreter by pressing CTRL-D or by entering the command exit(). 

##### Installing Sublime Text 
On Linux, you can install Sublime Text from the Ubuntu Software Center. Click the Ubuntu Software icon in your menu, and search for Sublime Text. Click to install it, and then launch it. 

### Running a Hello World Program 
With a recent version of Python and Sublime Text installed, you‚Äôre almost ready to run your first Python program written in a text editor. But before doing so, you need to make sure Sublime Text is set up to use the correct version of Python on your system. Then you‚Äôll write the Hello World! program and run it. 

#### Configuring Sublime Text to Use the Correct Python Version 
If the python command on your system runs Python 3, you won‚Äôt need to configure anything and can skip to the next section. If you use the python3 command, you‚Äôll need to configure Sublime Text to use the correct Python version when it runs your programs. Click the Sublime Text icon to launch it, or search for Sublime Text in your system‚Äôs search bar and then launch it. Go to Tools ‚ñ∏ Build System ‚ñ∏ New Build System, which will open a new configuration file for you. Delete what you see and enter the following: 

    Python3.sublime-build 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    {
    "cmd": ["python3", "-u", "$file"],
    } 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    
This code tells Sublime Text to use your system‚Äôs python3 command when running your Python program files. Save the file as Python3.sublime-build in the default directory that Sublime Text opens when you choose Save. 

### Running hello_world.py 
Before you write your first program, make a folder called python_work somewhere on your system for your projects. It‚Äôs best to use lowercase letters and underscores for spaces in file and folder names, because Python uses these naming conventions. Open Sublime Text, and save an empty Python file (File ‚ñ∏ Save As) called hello_world.py in your python_work folder. The extension .py tells Sublime Text that the code in your file is written in Python, which tells it how to run the program and highlight the text in a helpful way. After you‚Äôve saved your file, enter the following line in the text editor: 

    hello_world.py 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    print("Hello Python world!") 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    
If the python command works on your system, you can run your program by selecting Tools ‚ñ∏ Build in the menu or by pressing CTRL-B (Command-B on macOS). If you had to configure Sublime Text in the previous section, select Tools ‚ñ∏ Build System and then select Python 3. From now on you‚Äôll be able to select Tools ‚ñ∏ Build or just press CTRL-B (or -B) to run your programs. A terminal screen should appear at the bottom of the Sublime Text window, showing the following output: 

    Hello Python world!
    [Finished in 0.1s] 
    
If you don‚Äôt see this output, something might have gone wrong in the program. Check every character on the line you entered. Did you accidentally capitalize print? Did you forget one or both of the quotation marks or parentheses? Programming languages expect very specific syntax, and if you don‚Äôt provide that, you‚Äôll get errors. If you can‚Äôt get the program to run, see the suggestions in the next section. 

### Troubleshooting 
If you can‚Äôt get hello_world.py to run, here are a few remedies you can try that are also good general solutions for any programming problem: When a program contains a significant error, Python displays a traceback, which is an error report. Python looks through the file and tries to identify the problem. Check the traceback; it might give you a clue as to what issue is preventing the program from running. 
- Step away from your computer, take a short break, and then try again. Remember that syntax is very important in programming, so even a missing colon, a mismatched quotation mark, or mismatched parentheses can prevent a program from running properly. Reread the relevant parts of this chapter, look over your code, and try to find the mistake. 
- Start over again. You probably don‚Äôt need to uninstall any software, but it might make sense to delete your hello_world.py file and re-create it from scratch. 
- Ask someone else to follow the steps in this chapter, on your computer or a different one, and watch what they do carefully. You might have missed one small step that someone else happens to catch. 
- Find someone who knows Python and ask them to help you get set up. If you ask around, you might find that you unexpectedly know someone who uses Python. The setup instructions in this chapter are also available through the book‚Äôs companion website at [Nostarch.com](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e/). The online version of these instructions might work better for you because you can simply cut and paste code. 
- Ask for help online. Appendix C provides a number of resources, such as forums and live chat sites, where you can ask for solutions from people who‚Äôve already worked through the issue you‚Äôre currently facing. 

Never worry that you‚Äôre bothering experienced programmers. Every programmer has been stuck at some point, and most programmers are happy to help you set up your system correctly. As long as you can state clearly what you‚Äôre trying to do, what you‚Äôve already tried, and the results you‚Äôre getting, there‚Äôs a good chance someone will be able to help you. As mentioned in the Introduction, the Python community is very friendly and welcoming to beginners. Python should run well on any modern computer. Early setup issues can be frustrating, but they‚Äôre well worth sorting out. Once you get hello_world.py running, you can start to learn Python, and your programming work will become more interesting and satisfying. 

### Running Python Programs from a Terminal 
Most of the programs you write in your text editor you‚Äôll run directly from the editor. But sometimes it‚Äôs useful to run programs from a terminal instead. For example, you might want to run an existing program without opening it for editing. You can do this on any system with Python installed if you know how to access the directory where the program file is stored. To try this, make sure you‚Äôve saved the hello_world.py file in the python_work folder on your desktop. 

#### On Windows 
You can use the terminal command cd, for change directory, to navigate through your filesystem in a command window. The command dir, for directory, shows you all the files that exist in the current directory. Open a new terminal window and enter the following commands to run hello_world.py: 

    ‚ûä C:\> cd Desktop\python_work
    ‚ûã C:\Desktop\python_work> dir
       hello_world.py
    ‚ûå C:\Desktop\python_work> python hello_world.py
       Hello Python world! 
   
At ‚ûä you use the cd command to navigate to the python_work folder, which is in the Desktop folder. Next, you use the dir command to make sure hello_world.py is in this folder ‚ûã. Then you run the file using the command python hello_world.py ‚ûå. Most of your programs will run fine directly from your editor. But as your work becomes more complex, you‚Äôll want to run some of your programs from a terminal. 

#### On macOS and Linux 
Running a Python program from a terminal session is the same on Linux and macOS. You can use the terminal command cd, for change directory, to navigate through your filesystem in a terminal session. The command ls, for list, shows you all the nonhidden files that exist in the current directory. Open a new terminal window and enter the following commands to run hello_world.py: 
    ‚ûä ~$ cd Desktop/python_work/
    ‚ûã ~/Desktop/python_work$ ls
       hello_world.py
    ‚ûå ~/Desktop/python_work$ python hello_world.py
       Hello Python world! 
   
At ‚ûä you use the cd command to navigate to the python_work folder, which is in the Desktop folder. Next, you use the ls command to make sure hello_world.py is in this folder ‚ûã. Then you run the file using the command python hello_world.py ‚ûå. It‚Äôs that simple. You just use the python (or python3) command to run Python programs. 

### TRY IT YOURSELF 
The exercises in this chapter are exploratory in nature. Starting in Chapter 2, the challenges you‚Äôll solve will be based on what you‚Äôve learned. 

1-1. python.org: Explore the Python home page (https://python.org/) to find topics that interest you. As you become familiar with Python, different parts of the site will be more useful to you. 

1-2. Hello World Typos: Open the hello_world.py file you just created. Make a typo somewhere in the line and run the program again. Can you make a typo that generates an error? Can you make sense of the error message? Can you make a typo that doesn‚Äôt generate an error? Why do you think it didn‚Äôt make an error? 

1-3. Infinite Skills: If you had infinite programming skills, what would you build? You‚Äôre about to learn how to program. If you have an end goal in mind, you‚Äôll have an immediate use for your new skills; now is a great time to draft descriptions of what you want to create. It‚Äôs a good habit to keep an ‚Äúideas‚Äù notebook that you can refer to whenever you want to start a new project. Take a few minutes now to describe three programs you want to create. 

### Summary
In this chapter, you learned a bit about Python in general, and you installed Python on your system if it wasn‚Äôt already there. You also installed a text editor to make it easier to write Python code. You ran snippets of Python code in a terminal session, and you ran your first program, hello_world.py. You probably learned a bit about troubleshooting as well. In the next chapter, you‚Äôll learn about the different kinds of data you can work with in your Python programs, and you‚Äôll use variables as well.
